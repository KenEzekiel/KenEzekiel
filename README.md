### 👋 Hi! I'm ken!

I'm a fresh graduate from Bandung Institute of Technology's Informatics Engineering. I was the chairman of my student body, HMIF ITB, and also the CEO of Datare Innovation Solutions. I thrive on solving real world problems with my creative and critical mindset, with curiosity as a fuel for my learning. My main interest is in Blockchain technologies, as my Final Project is about a [Smart Contract Discovery Engine](https://github.com/KenEzekiel/tugas-akhir), written in LaTeX. Other than that, I am also keen on Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Systems, Cryptography, and Cybersecurity.

I am currently a Software Engineer at Xendit, the fastest growing payment gateway in SEA, and I am thriving with Xendit's engineering culture that pushes proactiveness and a high sense of ownership of projects. Not only that, I am also currently exploring the intricate and sophisticated system of Xendit's products, which I aim to be a contributor of!

Some of my writings can be found on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@KenEzekiel) or in [HMIF's Missing Semester Project](https://missing-semester.hmif.dev).

Some highlights on my projects:
